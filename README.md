# RLNotes
This is a collection of all notes about Reinforcement Learning.

2019-04-11
I created this project to record and share my personal notes when learning Reinforcement Learning.
One purpose is to share and communicate ahout my ideas on RL.
Another purpose (even more important) is to encourage myself to keep learning RL and take notes.

The main form of the notes would be markdown.
The main source of the knowledge comes from UCB CS294-112 Deep Reinforcement Learning.
The notes would be arranged by dates.

For anything you would like to express, feel free to add an issue.
For private communication, feel free to email me: 117010307@link.cuhk.edu.cn .
