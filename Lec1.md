What a good start! Let me review what this slide takes about. It seems nothing very important.

Maybe I would use MxNet or PyTorch instead of TensorFlow here.

End-to-end learning is essential for sequential decision making!

Beyond learning from reward:
1. From example: inverse reinforcement learning
2. Transferring knowledge between domains: transfer learning, meta-learning
3. Learning to predict and using prediction to act: from observing the world, unsupervised learning
